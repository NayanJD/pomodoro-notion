Its a very simple pomodoro clock which uses a notion database to store the pomodoro sessions. I use Notion to do task management. 
The structure of it is `Projects` > `Projects Tasks` > `Pomodoro Sessions`. The `>` means there exists one `Relation` type column
in the child database. The basic columns for `Pomodoro Sessions` are: `Name`, `Project Tasks`, `Start Date`, `End Date`. The column
`Project Tasks` is a relation type to `Project Tasks` database.
